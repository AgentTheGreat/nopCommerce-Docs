# Product attributes

Product attributes are **variations of a product** (such as color, size, etc.).

A user can create **different combinations** of the attributes. For example, a product can be in different sizes and colors. Thus, a user would create two attributes and their values, e.g. “size” (S, M, L) and “color” (Red, Blue, White), and then set up groups according to the availability of the products.

In nopCommerce, product attributes are used in **inventory tracking**, and can also cause the **price difference**.



To define product attributes go to **Catalog → Attributes → Product Attributes.**
